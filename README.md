# Crispy Public

CRISpy-pop is a web application that generates and filters guide RNA sequences for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. This tool focuses on generating guide RNA sequences for Yeast and Bacterial species used in bioenergy research. This tool supports a 1011 genome Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain set as well as a 167 strain set of S. cerevisiae isolates

This application is currently hosted by the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center here:
https://crispy-pop.glbrc.org/

The search by gene feature requires ~7 GB of reference data.  If you would like access to this data, please contact us at https://github.com/orgs/GLBRC/teams/glbrc_github_developers
