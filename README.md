# Crispy Public

CRISpy-pop is a web application that generates and filters guide RNA sequences for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. This tool focuses on generating guide RNA sequences for Yeast and Bacterial species used in bioenergy research. This tool supports a 1011 genome Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain set as well as a 167 strain set of S. cerevisiae isolates

This application is currently hosted by the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center here:

The search by gene feature requires ~7 GB of reference data.  If you would like access to this data, please contact us at [mailto](email:helpdesk@energy.wisc.edu?subject=CRISpy-pop%20--%20data%20access%20request&body=re%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FGLBRC%2FCRISpy-pop%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2FREADME.md%0D%0A%0D%0A---%0D%0A%0D%0AHello%2C%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20would%20like%20to%20request%20access%20to%20the%20CRISpy-pop%20reference%20data...%0D%0A%0D%0A)
